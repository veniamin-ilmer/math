# Logarithmic Exponentation

Addition and multiplication are quite useful because of their commutative properties. Exponentiation is harder to work with because of its lacking commutativity.

Inspired by the logarithmic product rule:

ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(a * b)

Let's work with a new operation:

ln(a) * ln(b) = ln(a @ b)

"@" just happened to be a convenient symbol available on the keyboard. It can be replaced with another symbol.

This operation has several useful properties. I will go each and compare with multiplication.

#### Communtative property

--------------|--------------
x * y = y * x | x @ y = y @ x

#### Associative property

(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)

(x @ y) @ z = x @ (y @ z)

#### Distributive property

x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z

x @ (y * z) = x @ y * x @ z
