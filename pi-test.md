# Which PI is best?

With the whole Tau movement going on, I tried to find out which form of PI makes the most sense.

Trying out 2 * Pi, Pi, Pi / 2, Pi / 3, Pi / 4, Pi / 8, to see which appears naturally in functions the most.

Assume:
* Tau = 2 * Pi
* Dau = Pi / 2
* Trau = Pi / 3
* Quau = Pi / 4
* Octau = Pi / 8

## Euclidean geometry

> Pi = C / d

> Tau = C / r

*C = circumference, d = diameter, r = radius*

* +1 point for Pi
* +1 point for Tau

> A = Pi * r ^ 2

> A = Quau * d ^ 2

*A = Area*

* +1 point for Pi
* +1 point for Quau

> V = r ^ 3 * Quau / 3

*V = Volume*

* +1 point for Quau

> SA = Quau * r ^ 2

*SA = Surface Area*

* +1 point for Quau

## Physics

> Cosmological constant: lamda = (Octau * G * rho) / (3 * c ^ 2)

* +1 point for Octau

> Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: delta x * delta p >= h / Quau

* +1 point for Quau

> Einstein's field equation of general relativity: Octau * G * T(uv) / c ^ 4

* +1 point for Octau

> Coulomb's law: F = |q1 * q2| / (Quau * permittivity * r ^ 2)

* +1 point for Quau

> Magnetic permeability: Quau * 10 ^ (-7) * N / A ^ 2

* +1 point for Quau

> Period of a simple pendulum: Tau * sqrt(L / g)

* +1 point for Tau

## Total Points

* Quau = 6
* Pi = 2
* Octau = 2
* Tau = 2
