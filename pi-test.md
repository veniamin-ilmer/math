# Which PI is best?

With the whole Tau movement going on, I tried to find out which form of PI makes the most sense.

Trying out 2 * Pi, Pi, Pi / 2, Pi / 3, Pi / 4, Pi / 8, to see which appears naturally in functions the most.

Assume:
* Tau = 2 * Pi
* Dau = Pi / 2
* Trau = Pi / 3
* Quau = Pi / 4
* Octau = Pi / 8

## Euclidean geometry

> Pi = C / d
> Tau = C / r

*C = circumference, d = diameter, r = radius*

* +1 point for Pi
* +1 point for Tau

> A = Pi * r ^ 2
> A = Quau * d ^ 2

*A = Area*

* +1 point for Pi
* +1 point for Quau

> V = 1 / 3 * Quau * r ^ 3

*V = Volume*

* +1 point for Quau

> SA = Quau * r ^ 2

*SA = Surface Area*

* +1 point for Quau

## Total Points

* Quau = 3
* Pi = 2
* Tau = 1
